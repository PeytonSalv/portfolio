## Outcome

**Founded consulting and product development studio delivering custom software and automation for small and mid-sized businesses.** Owned system architecture, frontend, backend, and deployment workflows end-to-end.

## Context

Small and mid-sized businesses often need custom software but lack internal engineering capacity. Cascade Core Solutions was founded to fill this gap—delivering production-grade platforms with the same rigor as enterprise software, scaled to business needs and budgets.

## Ownership

- Founded and operate the consulting studio
- Own full technical delivery: architecture, frontend, backend, deployment
- Direct client relationships and requirements gathering
- Sole engineer on all shipped projects

## Projects Delivered

### Bike Rental POS & Inventory System

**Designed and implemented a custom bike rental POS and inventory management system integrating bookings, deliveries, and real-time availability.**

- Built production web platform using React, Next.js, AWS Lambda, and Stripe
- Integrated booking workflows with delivery scheduling and inventory tracking
- Delivered admin tooling and dashboards used daily by business operators
- System handles real-time availability across multiple rental locations

### Production Web Platforms

- Built and deployed multiple client platforms using React, Next.js, and AWS
- Integrated third-party APIs for payments (Stripe), communications, and logistics
- Delivered high-reliability admin tooling for daily business operations

## Constraints

- **Budget**: SMB clients require cost-efficient solutions without sacrificing reliability
- **Timeline**: Fast delivery expectations—weeks, not months
- **Maintenance**: Systems must be maintainable without ongoing engineering support
- **Scope**: Must deliver complete, production-ready solutions—no handoffs

## Architecture / Approach

Standard stack for reliability and maintainability:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda for serverless compute, reducing operational overhead
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for secure, compliant payment processing
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment pipelines for consistent releases

Each project follows the same pattern: gather requirements, architect the solution, build incrementally, deploy to production, and hand off with documentation.

## Results

- Multiple production platforms shipped and in daily use by business operators
- High-reliability admin tooling supporting daily business workflows
- End-to-end ownership model enables faster delivery and clearer accountability
- Systems remain in production with minimal maintenance requirements

## What I'd Do Differently

**Standardize earlier**: Initial projects had more variation in tooling. Standardizing the stack earlier would have increased delivery velocity.

**Template more aggressively**: Common patterns (auth, payments, admin CRUD) could be templatized for faster project starts.
