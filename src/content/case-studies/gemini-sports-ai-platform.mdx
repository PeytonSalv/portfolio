## Outcome

**Owned end-to-end frontend architecture for a production platform serving 120+ professional soccer teams.** Built and scaled data-dense interfaces over a global dataset of 50,000+ professional players including contracts, valuations, and proprietary performance metrics.

## Context

Gemini Sports AI is an early-stage sports analytics startup building real-time scouting and roster intelligence platforms. The company needed a sole frontend engineer capable of owning the entire frontend surface—architecture decisions, performance optimization, and shipping customer-facing features across web, iOS, and Android.

## Ownership

- Sole frontend engineer responsible for platform architecture, performance, and production delivery
- Owned the frontend platform layer across web, iOS, and Android
- Led frontend implementation for player comparison, watchlists, and scouting workflows
- Owned the interface layer over a global professional player dataset
- Integrated backend AI workflows for natural language player lookup and report synthesis

## Constraints

- **Data density**: Interfaces must render 50,000+ player records with stats, contracts, and performance metrics without degrading UX
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase targeting web, iOS, and Android
- **Startup velocity**: Features needed to ship fast for client demos and daily workflows
- **Team size**: Single frontend engineer—no delegation, full ownership required
- **AI integration**: Natural language player lookup via SMS required OpenAI integration

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | React Native + Expo v54 |
| Routing | Expo Router (file-based, Next.js-style) |
| State | Apollo Client (GraphQL) + Zustand (local UI) |
| Styling | NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) |
| UI Components | Gluestack UI + 112 custom components |
| Charts | Victory Native for data visualization |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Yup validation |

### Backend Integration

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| API | GraphQL via Apollo Client |
| Auth | AWS Cognito with JWT token refresh |
| Real-time | Push notifications, activity feeds |
| Error Tracking | Sentry integration |

### Key Patterns

**Apollo Client link chain** with proactive token refresh (5-minute buffer), global error handling, and Relay-style pagination for infinite scroll.

**Zustand stores** for local UI state: filter selections, player comparisons, shadow team composition, knowledge graph interactions.

**Feature-based architecture**: Each feature (player-search, watchlist, scout-reports, similar-players) contains its own components, hooks, and business logic.

```
features/
├── player-search/      # Multi-filter search with suggestions
├── player-detail/      # Comprehensive player views
├── compare-players/    # Side-by-side stat comparison
├── similar-players/    # AI-powered recommendations
├── watchlist/          # Personal player tracking
├── scout-reports/      # FormIO report submission
├── shadow-team/        # Virtual squad builder
├── player-kanban/      # Drag-and-drop organization
└── knowledge-graph/    # Visual relationship mapping
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Virtualized lists** for rendering 50K+ player rows without scroll jank
- **Memoization** with useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations
- **Apollo cache normalization** for efficient GraphQL response caching
- **Platform-specific code** via `.native.tsx` and `.web.tsx` extensions

## Features Shipped

1. **Player Search**: Multi-filter search across 50,000+ players by position, team, league, nationality
2. **Player Comparison**: Side-by-side stat comparison with custom metric selection
3. **Similar Players**: AI-powered recommendations based on statistical similarity
4. **Watchlists**: Personal player tracking with organization sharing
5. **Scout Reports**: FormIO integration for structured report submission
6. **Shadow Teams**: Drag-and-drop virtual squad builder
7. **Player Kanban**: Status-based player organization with custom tags
8. **Knowledge Graph**: Visual player relationship mapping
9. **Activity Feed**: Real-time updates on player movements and reports

## Results

- Platform now core to daily workflows and client demos for 120+ professional soccer teams
- Cross-platform delivery: single codebase serving web, iOS, and Android
- Shipped 9 major features as sole frontend engineer
- Sub-second search across 50,000+ player dataset
- Zero-downtime deployments via Expo EAS

## What I'd Do Differently

**Earlier investment in design system**: Formalizing the component library earlier would have accelerated feature development. With 112 components now, a proper design system would reduce inconsistency.

**More aggressive code splitting**: Initial bundle size grew faster than expected. Establishing lazy loading patterns from day one would have improved initial load times.

**GraphQL fragment colocation**: Colocating GraphQL fragments with components earlier would have made data requirements clearer and reduced over-fetching.
