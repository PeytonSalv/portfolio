## TL;DR

- **Premise**: The same dataset can feel obvious or overwhelming depending entirely on how it is shaped.
- **Method**: Keep the dataset constant, change only the structure used to display it.
- **Finding**: Data density is not the enemy. Unstructured density is.

## Premise

The same dataset can feel obvious or overwhelming depending entirely on how it is shaped.

This exploration looks at how different presentation models affect speed of understanding, perceived clarity, and decision confidence.

Rather than changing the data, I kept the dataset constant and changed only the structure used to display it.

## Dataset

A fixed, moderately dense dataset representing entities with multiple quantitative attributes.

Example dimensions:

- Performance metrics
- Categorical attributes
- Relative rankings
- Deltas vs baseline

The goal was not realism, but repeatability. Every view renders the exact same information.

## Experiment

The dataset is rendered in four different visual forms.

### 1. Table

A traditional dense table optimized for precision.

**Characteristics:**

- Maximal information per square inch
- Fastest for exact comparisons
- Highest cognitive load for first-time readers

**Observations:**

- Power users perform well
- New users struggle to identify what matters
- Visual hierarchy collapses under density

### 2. Cards

Data grouped into individual entity cards.

**Characteristics:**

- Strong local context
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced scan efficiency at scale

**Observations:**

- Easier to read initially
- Harder to compare across entities
- Encourages narrative thinking over analysis

### 3. Graph

Metrics mapped into a visual encoding.

**Characteristics:**

- Immediate pattern recognition
- Relative performance becomes obvious
- Exact values become secondary

**Observations:**

- Trends are understood quickly
- Outliers stand out naturally
- Precision requires secondary interaction

### 4. Layered Overlay

A hybrid view combining multiple representations.

**Characteristics:**

- Primary signal shown visually
- Secondary data layered on demand
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

**Observations:**

- Best balance of speed and depth
- Users naturally focus on meaningful differences
- Complexity becomes optional rather than mandatory

## Visual Interaction

Users can toggle between representations while preserving:

- Selection state
- Hovered entities
- Highlighted attributes

This makes differences in comprehension immediately apparent rather than theoretical.

## Attention Mapping

An optional heatmap overlay approximates eye-tracking behavior based on interaction patterns:

- Hover dwell time
- Cursor velocity
- Focus changes

This highlights where users actually look, not where designers assume they do.

**Key insight:** Visual emphasis often diverges from data importance.

## What Changed My Thinking

Data density is not the enemy. Unstructured density is.

The most effective interfaces do not remove information. They shape it so users encounter complexity only when they are ready.

Good design is not about making things simpler. It is about making complexity legible.

## Why This Matters

Most product decisions fail not because the data is wrong, but because the interface hides the signal.

Understanding the shape of information is a prerequisite for building trustworthy, high-stakes systems.

## Implementation Notes

- Single source of truth for data
- View adapters map data into each representation
- Shared interaction state across views
- Heatmap derived from interaction telemetry, not real eye tracking
